            Founded over 150 years ago, Phi Psi boasts a rich history at many of
            the nationâ€™s top colleges and universities.<br /><br />
            William H. Letterman and Charles P.T. Moore founded Phi Kappa Psi in
            the little college town of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, when they were
            nursing their stricken friends during an epidemic of typhoid fever
            at their college. It was through these long night vigils that an
            appreciation of the great joy of serving others came into their
            lives.

            <br /><br />Phi Kappa Psi recognizes the need and value of the best
            and broadest education possible and encourages that goal within our
            membership. But unless actuated by a proper love for and service to
            mankind, the educated man may often waste his talents. It is to
            counteract this tendency that Phi Kappa Psi was founded to encourage
            the best in men, to inspire and assist them to reach their potential
            as students, brothers, men and citizens.
