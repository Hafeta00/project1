1. What did you like about this website?
I really like the way he decorated everything.  It's all very well-themed and appopriate for the theme.  He did a great job.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.

    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think his site is way cooler because of the creativity with how he set everything up, that being said, I really dislike having to use the back arrows at the top to navigate back to the home page, and would really appreciate at least a home link somewhere on the website, even though I felt like almost every page could support a navbar, and should have probably had that anyways.

    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I think my code is more maintainable as I have only one CSS file that you need to update, as I tried to keep special formats to a minimum.  That being said, I feel like this style of site is inherently hard to maintain as almost none of the pages have any common format elementss.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
I'd say so.  The files are put into appropriate directories.  Its fairly obvious to see whats going on in each file.

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    1. Were semantically appropriate elements selected?
    Yes.  To nitpick, if I were to make this myself I would definitely use more specific class names.  For example, on exec your image container is just called "container."  I would definitely call it something more like "portrait-container."

    2. Is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Its hard to say.  I'm not eager to comb through 700 lines of CSS and with the nature of how he did the website it seems that each page is truly unique in formatting.  So I'm not surprised at the choice to have a different css file for every page.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
Great job!  I really like this website and I would be really proud of it if I were you.  Great theming and creative choices.  Maybe the exec page could have had some text to explain who these people were?
